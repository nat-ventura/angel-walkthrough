// What is React?

// React is a JS library used to produce HTML shown to a user in a browser.
// When we write React code, we're writing individual React components, or views.
// Components are individuals snippets of code that PRODUCE HTML.

// We nest these components by placing one inside the other to make complex applications more simple.
// When we write in React, we're writing JS but it will ultimately produce HTML.
